# Detection-of-Manipulation-in-audio-files-using-metadata-and-spectrograph-analysis
In today’s fast-evolving landscape of digital technology, powerful tools have emerged that enable detailed editing and enhancement of audio content. Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) such as Reaper and Audacity provide precise, fine-grained control—allowing users to cut, copy, paste, and rearrange audio segments effortlessly.

This project involved the manipulation and analysis of 35 audio samples, comprising:
- 30 audio recordings from Android devices (versions 10 to 13)
- 5 audio recordings from iOS devices (version 16)

### Editing Process
Audio files were edited using:
- Reaper: A professional-grade DAW with advanced capabilities for multitrack editing and mixing.
- Audacity: A widely-used open-source audio editor for quick waveform-based edits.

### Key editing techniques included:
- Trimming and rearranging segments
- Adjusting volume levels and panning
- Applying basic effects to enhance clarity and tonal balance

### Audio Forensics and Metadata Analysis
- Post-editing analysis was performed using:
- MediaInfo: To compare metadata between original and edited files
- Sonic Visualiser and Spectrum Analyzer: To visualize spectrograms and frequency changes, helping identify areas of alteration

### Observations
- Metadata Analysis shoes an overview of the file's parameters is, which allows the detection of altered data.
- Spectrogram Analysis was been performed which helped in viewing the spectrum of the audio file through which alterations/manipulations were observed.
- It was observed that sonic visualizer was a better tool for carrying out spectrogram analysis and detecting alterations in audio.
- A technique was been proposed to detect alterations/manipulations in the audio files by following proper procedure and documentation of the digital evidence obtained.
